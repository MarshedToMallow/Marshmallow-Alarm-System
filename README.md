# MAS - Marshmallow Alarm System
A custom alarm clock that meets my personal requirements

# Todo

## Requirements

- [ ] Daily alarms (i.e. 2pm every day)
- [ ] Custom "snooze" time (Push the alarm by some amount)
- [ ] Alarms defined in relation to others (X hours after alarm Y, affected by "Snooze")
- [ ] Notifications 1, 5, and 15 minutes before the alarm goes off

## Quality of Life

- [ ] Custom alarm sound
- [ ] Additional conditions (i.e. round to the nearest X, between X and Y alarms, etc)
- [ ] Additional repeat cycles (i.e. every X time)
- [ ] Cleaner UI

*Beyond that list, I might try for more features (and might think of more) but that's the primary focus.*
